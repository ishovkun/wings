# Wings
**Wings** is a blackoil reservoir simulator coupled with geomechanics.
It is a work in progress and currently has pretty much nothing.

## Main idea
The main insentive for this software is to couple FEM-based mechanical equations
with FVM-based fluid flow within the framework of **deal.ii** library (which is done
rarely if ever).
