** 3D bitmap input
*** DONE Write code for treating bitmap input
    CLOSED: [2017-12-21 Thu 18:02]
*** Test 3D heterogeneous bitmap
** Parallelize
*** Use trilinos parallel classes
*** Properly extract fevalues and distribute into the stiffness matrix
*** Locate wellbore on cell interfaces between two processes


 Use cell->point_inside() to check if wellbore is in a cell
** Wells
*** Well segment function is either inaccurate or slow
** Problems
*** DONE Inclined well calculation is wrong
