*** TODO Properly distribute into the stiffness matrix
*** Locate wellbore on cell interfaces between two processes


 Use cell->point_inside() to check if wellbore is in a cell
** Wells
*** Well segment function is either inaccurate or slow
** Problems
*** DONE Inclined well calculation is wrong

*** I am calculating face transmissibilities twice!
*** Pieceman formula valid only for r << r_pieceman
    add check as a runtime parameter!!!!
*** G vector: should I additionally multiply by cell normal?
