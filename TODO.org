* General
** Handle units
** Adaptive mesh refinement
   Make PressureSolver work with refined mesh, see

** Write code for treating bitmap input
** Parallelize
*** Use trilinos parallel classes
*** Properly extract fevalues and distribute into the stiffness matrix
*** Locate wellbore on cell interfaces between two processes


 Use cell->point_inside() to check if wellbore is in a cell
