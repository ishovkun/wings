** Write code for treating bitmap input
** Parallelize
*** Use trilinos parallel classes
*** Properly extract fevalues and distribute into the stiffness matrix
*** Locate wellbore on cell interfaces between two processes


 Use cell->point_inside() to check if wellbore is in a cell
** Wells
approximated algorithm for inclined well permeabiltiy
wellbore unit tangent a = {ax, ay, az}
we calculate effective permeability as
k = kx^(0.5-ax/2)*ky^(0.5-ay/2)*kz^(0.5-ax/2)
let's see what this approach gives us:
if a = {0, 0, 1}, then k = kx^0.5 * ky^0.5
