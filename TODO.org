* General
** TODO Arithmetic mean for properties should take cell sizes into account
** DONE Put FluidEquations into ConstitutiveModel namespace and rename it into .., make ExtraValues callse FluidEquations

   Info on how to handle: https://www.dealii.org/8.4.0/doxygen/deal.II/step_46.html
** Refinement at saturation fronts
** Initial refinement at water-oil-contact
* 3D bitmap input
** Test 3D heterogeneous bitmap
* Problems
** Well segment function is either inaccurate or slow
** I am calculating face transmissibilities twice!
** Pieceman formula valid only for r << r_pieceman
   add check as a runtime parameter, impose constraints if cell is too small !!!!
