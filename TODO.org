* General
** DONE Model should decide which phase is oil water or gas, not cellvalues
   CLOSED: [2018-03-09 Fri 14:26]
** DONE Merge SaturationSolver and PressureSolver into FLuidSolverIMPES
   CLOSED: [2018-02-16 Fri 18:20]
** Simulator should take model as an argument
** DONE Harmonic Mean for transmissibility should take cell sizes into account
   CLOSED: [2018-01-31 Wed 12:15]
** TODO Arithmetic mean for properties should take cell sizes into account
** DONE Make impes solver have only one owned solution
   CLOSED: [2018-02-16 Fri 18:20]
   have solution instead of pressure_solution and saturation_solution
** DONE Allow creating cubic mesh with n_elements and dimensions
   CLOSED: [2018-02-16 Fri 18:20]
   also allow mesh file keyword
** DONE Put FluidEquations into ConstitutiveModel namespace and rename it into .., make ExtraValues callse FluidEquations
   CLOSED: [2018-03-09 Fri 14:26]
** TODO Do some sort of location Probe class that would be responsible for getting data instead of model.

   CLOSED: [2018-01-25 Thu 23:57]
** TODO Output units
** Field report geometry Units
** DONE Units in bitmap
   CLOSED: [2018-01-30 Tue 10:34]
* Adaptive mesh refinement
** DONE PressureSolver and Wells work with refined mesh
   CLOSED: [2017-12-22 Fri 18:36]
   Info on how to handle: https://www.dealii.org/8.4.0/doxygen/deal.II/step_46.html
** Refinement at saturation fronts
** Initial refinement at water-oil-contact
* 3D bitmap input
** DONE Implement
** DONE Test 1D bitmap
   CLOSED: [2018-02-16 Fri 18:21]
** Test 3D heterogeneous bitmap
* DONE Parallelize
  CLOSED: [2018-02-10 Sat 13:00]
* Problems
** Well segment function is either inaccurate or slow
** I am calculating face transmissibilities twice!
** Pieceman formula valid only for r << r_pieceman
   add check as a runtime parameter, impose constraints if cell is too small !!!!
