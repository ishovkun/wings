   Info on how to handle: https://www.dealii.org/8.4.0/doxygen/deal.II/step_46.html
* 3D bitmap input
** DONE Implement
** Test 3D heterogeneous bitmap
* Parallelize
** DONE Use trilinos parallel classes
** DONE Properly extract fevalues
   CLOSED: [2017-12-22 Fri 18:37]
** DONE Properly distribute into the stiffness matrix
** DONE Locate wellbore on cell interfaces between two processes


Use cell->point_inside() to check if wellbore is in a cell
* Problems
** Well segment function is either inaccurate or slow
** DONE Inclined well calculation is wrong

** I am calculating face transmissibilities twice!
** Pieceman formula valid only for r << r_pieceman
   add check as a runtime parameter!!!!
** DONE G vector
